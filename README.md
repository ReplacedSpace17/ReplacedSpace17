<h1 align="center">Hello World! 🖖</h1>

<p align="justify">
I am a graduate student in Computer Science at the National Technological Institute of Mexico, with a strong research-oriented profile focused on the application of artificial intelligence to biological systems. My work lies at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and bioinformatics, with particular emphasis on the analysis of microscopic imagery and sensor data for the monitoring and optimization of freshwater microalgae cultures.
<br><br>
I have experience designing data-driven models, modular software frameworks, and real-time inference pipelines for controlled biological environments. My interests include applied machine learning, scientific software development, and research and development (R&D) in interdisciplinary contexts that bridge computational methods with experimental sciences.
