### You must never forget that
We must understand that we all make mistakes and not forgiving is the cause of so many graves without flowers.

There will never be a revolution without evolution of consciousness. The difference is up to you.

If you don't sweep up the shit today, maybe tomorrow you'll step on it.

Respect is not deserved by the bad, if not the one who achieves happiness, that is more of a thug.

Admirable is the one who dies for his ideals. Respectable is that man who respected the likes of him.
